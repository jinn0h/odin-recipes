        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kimchi-jjigae (김치찌개) or kimchi stew is a jjigae, or stew-like Korean dish, made with kimchi and other ingredients, such as pork or seafood, scallions, onions, and diced Dubu. It is one of the most common stews in Korean cuisine.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup of Aged Kimchi (Should taste slightly sour)</li>
            <li>¼ Whole Onion</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Gochujang Paste</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Can of Tuna (~150 grams)</li>
            <li>2.5 Cups Water (~625 ml)</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Gochugaru Flakes</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Korean Anchovy Fish Sauce (or substitute with 1T of Soy Sauce)</li>
            <li>½ Tablespoon Minced Garlic</li>
            <li>½ Block Firm Tofu (~175 grams)</li>
        </ul>
 
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <h5>Prep Ingredients</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop some well-aged Kimchi. Cut enough to fill 1 cup - and set it aside for later. (Note: Pour any leftover kimchi juice on your cutting board into the cup as well).</li>

            <li>Dice ¼ a whole onion into thin strips.</li>

            <li>Cut a finger-length piece of spring onion stalk into thin circles.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Stir-Fry Kimchi</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chopped Kimchi and sliced onions into a large pot or wok.</li>

            <li>Add-in Gochujang Paste (1 Tablespoon).</li>

            <li>Followed by Soy Sauce (1 Tablespoon).</li>

            <li>Then carefully open a can of tuna. Press the lid against the tuna and add-in only the oil at this point! (We'll add-in the actual tuna chunks at the end.)</li>

            <li>Place the pot on medium-high heat. Once it starts to sizzle, set a timer for 4 minutes! Stir-fry for 4 minutes - and remember to continuously stir (or else it will burn).</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Putting everything together</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>After 4 minutes of stir-frying, add in 2.5 cups (~625 ml) of water.</li>

            <li>Use a wooden spatula and scrape off any bits on the side of the pot into the soup.</li>

            <li>Now add-in Gochugaru Flakes (1 Tablespoon).</li>

            <li>Followed by Korean Anchovy Fish Sauce (1 Tablespoon). (Note: You can also substitute the Fish Sauce with 1T of Soy Sauce).</li>

            <li>Once it comes to a boil, add in Minced Garlic (½ Tablespoon).</li>

            <li>Then, add-in the by Sliced Chili Peppers as well as a few cracks of Black Pepper.</li>

            <li>Now let this soup boil away for 2 minutes!</li>

            <li>After 2 minutes, carefully add the sliced tofu pieces to one side of the pot.</li>

            <li>Finally scoop the tuna into the middle of the pot.</li>

            <li>Let everything boil away for a final 1 minute - all the flavors will come together!</li>

            <li>Bon Appetit - serve with a bowl of hot rice!</li>
        </ol>
